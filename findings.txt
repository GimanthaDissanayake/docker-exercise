Above is the respone I got when I ran the docker-compose file. From this I can see that the 2 services share the disk_space. That means the containers share the storage resources.
Also by looking at the ip_address they are using the same docker bridge network 172.18.0.x.
Other than that I know that the containers use the same OS Kernel of the host system since it is one of the main difference between containers and VMs.
